         <h1 style="text-align:left"><br />Hi, I’m an aspiring programmer/computer scientist. You probably don’t see many CS people with a background in synthetic organic chemistry. Long story short, as an undergraduate I devoted much of my studies/free time to chemistry. Yet, while I found the material extremely interesting, I was not as enthused about handling large amounts of pyrophoric, neurotoxic, and carcinogenic chemicals on a daily basis. So in June 2018, after much consideration, I came to the conclusion that working in an organic chemistry lab was not what I wanted to do for the rest of my life, and so I decided to not attend graduate school that fall as originally planned. <br /><br />Computer science, which offered both new career opportunities as well as a potential avenue to engage in research without the lab work, seemed like a good discipline to learn. So, for the past few months, with guidance from CS friends working in both academia and industry, I lived at the library and did just that. To my pleasant surprise, I found that I enjoyed it and that in many ways it was similar to organic chemistry - a logic based, goal-oriented discipline which requires not only a thorough understanding of the language of the field, but also creativity and perseverance to come up with effective and streamlined solutions. With the fundamentals covered and some projects under my belt,  I am eager to continue gaining experience in this exciting field.
